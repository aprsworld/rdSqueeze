# rdSqueeze

## Purpose

The programs build encoding tables,  encode binary data file, decode binary files that have been encoded.
The encode program is lightweight and parts can be embedded in the data acquisition programs.   The actual encoding
fumction should be usable on low power cpu with severe memory limits.

At this time everything here is working but probably will change during deployment.
